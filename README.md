# Sales_Prediction_using_Python_and_ML

## Overview

This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the sales performance of a product across diverse advertising platforms. By thoroughly exploring various promotional channels, the goal is to comprehend and anticipate the impact of marketing efforts on product sales.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading:**
   The project initiates by loading the sales data, a pivotal step in preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling.

2. **Preprocessing and Data Cleansing:**
   Following data loading, preprocessing and data cleansing procedures are applied to ensure the dataset's quality and readiness for analysis.

3. **Model Building and Training:**
   Multiple machine learning algorithms are employed for regression, aiming to build models that predict product sales accurately.

4. **Ensemble Model Exploration:**
   In addition to individual models, an ensemble model is experimented with, combining various machine learning algorithms to achieve superior performance.

## Problem Approach

The primary focus of this project is to predict product sales using regression techniques. Additionally, an exploration into ensemble modeling is conducted to enhance predictive capabilities.

## System Requirements

No specific prerequisites are necessary for system requirements. A functional PC and an internet connection are sufficient. The project is designed to be easily accessible via Google Colab â€“ simply load the file, and you're ready to commence analyzing and predicting product sales.
